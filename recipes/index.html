        Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd 
        and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. 
        Leftovers will keep you happy for days.

            <b>Start by making the sauce </b> </br>with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.
        </li>

            <b>
                Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. 
            </b></br>
            We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!

            <b>
                From there, it's just an assembly job.
            </b></br>
            A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.
